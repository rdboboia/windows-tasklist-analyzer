# windows-tasklist-analyzer
A simple tool that takes information from the windows tasklist command and provides methods to analyze that data in order to make more use of it.

The main idea was born trying to see if all the tasks from tasklist add up to the total memory in use reported by other tools.

For now I'm working on parsing the output of the command (almost done by now) and I'll create some functions to sort and calculate more usefull results from the given data.
